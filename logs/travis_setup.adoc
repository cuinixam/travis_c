== Why setup up a Travis Ci file?

Well, let's say you developed your software normally and you have tests to verify
the correct behavior of the code you wrote :D

And now let's assume your best friend JARVIS wants to contribute also...
He makes some changes and then pushes them to your repository.

Now, you could trust JARVIS that: "I tested and it was working on my PC!" or you
could reproduce the same state of his commit on a fresh machine, run the tests
and in case of success deploy an executable :D

Travis CI provides you the environment (virgin Virtual Machines) to accomplish this!


== Minimal Travis CI file for building a C project

.Add the travis configuration file to the project:

_.travis.yml_

 language: c


.Enable the job on your Travis account
